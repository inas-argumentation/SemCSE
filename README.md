## SemCSE: Semantic Contrastive Sentence Embeddings Using LLM-Generated Summaries For Scientific Abstracts

To train your own SemCSE model and directly evaluate it on our newly created semantic benchmark, simply run `main.py`. The few lines of code contained in it should be largely self-explanatory.

### Repository Structure

- `data` contains the dataset of 350,000 scientific abstracts with corresponding LLM-generated summaries.
- `generate_search_queries.py` and `generate_train_summaries.py` are used to generate the queries used within the query-matching benchmark task and the summaries used for training, respectively.
- `load_data.py` is used to load the summaries during training.
- `semantic_benchmark.py` contains code for evaluating models on our proposed semantic benchmark.
- `settings.py` contains global hyperparameter. Here, you can set whether you want to train the model using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
- `train_embedding_model.py` contains the code for training the SemCSE model.

For evaluations on the SciRepEval benchmark, please use the [code from the original study](https://github.com/allenai/scirepeval).

### The Novel Semantic Embedding Benchmark

We propose a new benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of embedding models to encode the precise underlying semantics.
The benchmark contains four tasks:
- *Title–Abstract Matching*: Match paper titles to their corresponding abstracts. A good semantic model should produce similar embeddings for both.
- *Abstract Segmentation Consistency*: Match two halves of the same abstract. Both parts represent the same core content, and strong semantic embeddings should reflect that.
- *Query Matching*: Match a paper to a search query generated from it using a large language model (Mistral 3.1 small).
- *Semantic Clustering*: Given papers with thematic labels (from SciDocs MAG), retrieve nearest neighbors and measure how well the embedding space groups semantically similar papers.

### The SemCSE model

We introduce SemCSE, a novel unsupervised training scheme for creating high-quality semantic embeddings for scientific texts by focusing purely on their content, rather than relying on noisy citation-based signals. It is trained using a contrastive objective where the model learns to identify that different summaries of the same abstract, generated by an LLM, share a common underlying meaning. This approach forces the model to learn a robust and semantically-focused representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring deep semantic understanding. This is also highlighted by the stronger semantic separation achieved by SemCSE when clustering scientific abstracts on the SciDocs MAG dataset:

SemCSE achieves state-of-the-art results on our Semantic Embedding Benchmark, as well as on the SciRepEval benchmark when comparing against models of its size:
